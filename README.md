# High Energy Lingo

This is an unofficial guide to the acronyms, abbreviations, and other shorthand used in high energy physics (HEP). It's a work in progress, and likely geared more toward CMS collaborators, especially those working on HCAL. 

## How to use

The acronyms, data and shorthand are alphabetized on this page. Use *ctrl+f* or *command+f* to search this page for the acronym or keyword you want to find.

You may search this README.md file from the command line with 

```grep ABC README.md```

where ABC is the acronym or keyword you wish to find. If a relevant acronym is not listed, please add it when you figure out what it means! For instructions, see the next section.
